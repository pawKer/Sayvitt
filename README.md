## 💬 Overview

A better way to manage you saved posts on Reddit. Just log in using your account and start organizing!

## 🏆 Features

- Easily manage your saved posts

- Unsave multiple posts at once

- Search for any keyword

- Filter by subreddit

- Import and export posts as JSON

- No data is stored

## 🚀 Quick start

To run locally you can just do `npm run dev`, but make sure to provide the API keys and redirect URI in the `.env` files for both the server and the client before starting. Check the `.env.example` files for guidance.

## 🧠 Advanced tools

The advanced tools allow you to export all (or only selected) posts to a JSON file which can then be imported into a different account. This will allow you to easily migrate all the saved posts you want to a new account.
